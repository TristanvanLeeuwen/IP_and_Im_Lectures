    "In both cases, the amount of data needed is multiplied by a factor close\n",
    "to 100 (either 100 2D slices or an additional dimension). This time, the\n",
    "acquisition would last several seconds or even minutes, depending on the\n",
    "sequence timings $T_R$ and $T_E$. In this analysis, I consider only the\n",
    "duration of the *sampling* component, remember (cf. {numref}`sequence`)\n",
    "that also RF events need to be played out in order to drive and keep the\n",
    "magnetization in a desired state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toward the end of the previous century, a solution strategy was found to\n",
    "accelerate the scans. It all began around the year 1990 when multiple\n",
    "receive channels were introduced to increase the signal-to-noise-ratio\n",
    "(SNR). However, MRI scientists soon realized that using multiple coils\n",
