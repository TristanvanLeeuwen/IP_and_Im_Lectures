    "* We can easily verify that it indeed satisfies the differential equation by computing $v_t$ and $v_{xx}$. To show that it satisfies the initial condition, we take the limit $t\\rightarrow 0$ and use that $\\lim_{t\\rightarrow 0} \\int g_t(x)u(x) \\mathrm{d}x = u(0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Setting $t = T$ in the previous expression gives the desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This follows from the [convolution theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The inverse of $K$ is naively given by multiplication with $(Fg_T)^{-1}$ in the Fourier domain. We have $\\widehat{g}_T(\\xi) \\propto e^{-T \\xi^2}$ so we can only usefully define the inverse on functions whose Fourier spectrum decays fast enough such that the inverse Fourier transform of $\\widehat{f}/\\widehat{g}_T$ can be defined. Thus a solution does not exist for a large class of $f$ and noise is amplified exponentially. This only gets worse for larger $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* See the code below. We compute the total error using the function `reconstruct` which computes noisy data and reconstructs using the regularised inverse. To get a more stable result we average over a number of random instances of the noise. Using $\\alpha(\\delta) = \\delta$ gives a (numerically) convergent result, however for large $\\delta$ it gives a very large error. Picking $\\alpha(\\delta)$ to converge a bit slower allows one to keep the relative total error below 1. Note that we only show convergence of the error for one particular $u$, so we cannot conclude that this will work in general as in a previous exercise. If you like Fourier analysis and sampling theory, this may be a nice exercise.\n",

Investigate the accuracy of the reconstruction (use `np.linalg.solve` to solve $Ku = f$). Note that the exact solution is given by $u(x) = 3x^2$. Do you see the regularizing effect of $n$?\n",
