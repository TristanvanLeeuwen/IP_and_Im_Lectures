# Linear inverse problems in function spaces

Many of the notions discussed in the finite-dimensional setting can be extended to the infinite-dimensional setting. We will focus in this chapter on inverse problems where $K$ is a [*bounded linear operator*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_operator) and $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are (infinite-dimensional) function spaces. The contents of this chapter were heavily inspired by the excellent [lecture notes from Matthias J. Ehrhardt and Lukas F. Lang](https://mehrhardt.github.io/data/201803_lecture_notes_invprob.pdf).

Let $K: \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}$ denote the forward operator, with $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ [Banach spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space). The operator is bounded iff there exists a constant $C \geq 0$ such that

$$\|Ku\|_{\mathcal{F}} \leq C \|u\|_{\mathcal{U}} \quad \forall u \in \mathcal{U}.$$

The smallest such constant is called the operator norm $\|K\|$. Note that boundedness also implies continuity, i.e. for any $u,v \in \mathcal{U}$ we have

$$\|Ku - Kv\|_{\mathcal{F}} \leq C \|u - v\|_{\mathcal{U}}.$$

## Well-posedness

We may again wonder whether the equation $Ku = f$ is well-posed. To formally analyse this we introduce the following notation:

* $\mathcal{D}(K) = \mathcal{U}$ denotes the *domain* of $K$,
* $\mathcal{R}(K) = \{Ku\,|\,u\in\mathcal{U}\}$ denotes the *range* of $K$,
* $\mathcal{N}(K) = \{u\in\mathcal{U}\, | \, Ku = 0 \}$ denotes the *null-space* or *kernel* of $K$.

When $f \not\in \mathcal{R}(K)$, a solution obviously doesn't exist. We can still look for a solution for which $Ku \approx f$ by solving

```{math}
:label: minres
\min_{u\in \mathcal{U}}\|Ku - f\|_{\mathcal{F}}.
```

A solution to {eq}`minres` is a vector $\widetilde{u} \in \mathcal{U}$ for which

$$\|K\widetilde{u} - f\|_{\mathcal{F}} \leq \|Ku - f\|_{\mathcal{F}}, \quad \forall u \in \mathcal{U}.$$

If such a vector exists we call it the *minimum-residual* solution. If the null-space of $K$ is non-empty, we can construct infinitely many such solutions. We call the one with the smallest norm the *minimum-norm* solution. Note however that we have not yet proven that such a solution exists in general, nor do we have a constructive way of finding it.

## Bounded operators on Hilbert spaces

To study well-posedness of {eq}`minres` and the corresponding minimum-norm problem we will let $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ be [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space). We will return to analyzing variational problems more generally in a [later chapter](./variational_formulations).

---

First, we introduce the [adjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose_of_a_linear_map) of $K$, denoted by $K^*$ in the usual way as satisfying

$$\langle Ku, f \rangle_{\mathcal{F}} = \langle K^*\!f, u \rangle_{\mathcal{U}}\quad \forall u\in\mathcal{U}, \forall f\in\mathcal{F}.$$

We further denote the *orthogonal complement* of a subspace $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{U}$ as

$$\mathcal{X}^\perp = \{u\in\mathcal{U} \, | \, \langle u, v \rangle_{\mathcal{U}}=0 \, \forall \, v \in \mathcal{X}\}.$$

If $\mathcal{X}$ is a [closed subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set) we have $(\mathcal{X}^\perp)^\perp = \mathcal{X}$ and we have an orthogonal decomposition of $\mathcal{U}$ given by $\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{X} \oplus \mathcal{X}^\perp$, meaning that we can express *any* $u\in \mathcal{U}$ as $u = x + x^\perp$ with $x\in\mathcal{X}$ and $x^\perp\in\mathcal{X}^\perp$.
The [orthogonal projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra)) onto $\mathcal{X}$ is denoted by $P_{\mathcal{X}}$. We briefly recall a few useful relations

```{admonition} Lemma : *Orthogonal projection*
:class: important

Let $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{U}$ be a closed subspace. The orthogonal projection onto $\mathcal{X}$ satisfies the following conditions

1. $P_{\mathcal{X}}$ is self-adjoint,
2. $\|P_{\mathcal{X}}\| = 1,$
3. $I - P_{\mathcal{X}} = P_{\mathcal{X}^\perp},$
4. $\|u - P_{\mathcal{X}}u\|_{\mathcal{U}} \leq \|u - v\|_{\mathcal{U}} \, \forall \, v\in\mathcal{X}$,
5. $v = P_{\mathcal{X}}u$ iff $v\in\mathcal{X}$ and $u-v\in\mathcal{X}^\perp$.

```

When $\mathcal{X}$ is not closed we have $(\mathcal{X}^\perp)^\perp = \overline{\mathcal{X}}$ (the [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(topology)) of $\mathcal{X}$). Note that the orthogonal complement of a subspace is always closed.

We now have the following useful relations

* $\mathcal{R}(K)^\perp = \mathcal{N}(K^*),$
* $\mathcal{N}(K^*)^\perp = \overline{\mathcal{R}(K)},$
* $\mathcal{R}(K^*)^\perp = \mathcal{N}(K),$
* $\mathcal{N}(K)^\perp = \overline{\mathcal{R}(K^*)},$

from which we conclude that we can decompose $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ as

* $\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{N}(K) \oplus \overline{\mathcal{R}(K^*)},$
* $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{N}(K^*) \oplus \overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}.$

---
We now have the following results

```{admonition} Theorem: *Existence and uniqueness of the minimum-residual, minimum-norm solution*
:class: important

Given a bounded linear operator $K$ and $f \in \mathcal{F}$, a solution $\widetilde{u}$ to {eq}`minres`

* only exists if $f \in \mathcal{R}(K) \oplus \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp$
* obeys the *normal equations* $K^*\! K\widetilde{u} = K^*\! f.$

The unique solution $\widetilde{u} \in \mathcal{N}(K)^{\perp}$ to the normal equations is called the *minimum-norm* solution.

```

```{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

First, we show that a minimum-residual solution necessarily obeys the normal equations:

* Given a solution $\widetilde{u}$ to {eq}`minres` and an arbritary $v\in\mathcal{U}$, define $\phi(\alpha) = \|K(\widetilde{u} + \alpha v) - f\|_{\mathcal{F}}$. A necessary condition for $\widetilde{u}$ to be a least-squares solution is $\phi'(0) = 0$, which gives $\langle K^*(K\widetilde{u}-f),v \rangle_{\mathcal{U}}$. As this should hold for arbritary $v$, we find the normal equations. Note that this also implies that $K\widetilde{u} - f \in \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp$.

Next, we show that the normal equations only allow a solution when $f \in \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp \oplus \mathcal{R}(K)$.

* Given a solution $\widetilde{u}$, we find that $f = K\widetilde{u} + g$ with $g\in\mathcal{R}(K)^\perp$. Hence, $f \in \mathcal{R}(K) \oplus \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp$. Conversely, given $f \in \mathcal{R}(K) \oplus \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp$ , there exist $u \in \mathcal{U}$ and $g \in \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp = \left(\overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}\right)^\perp$ such that $f = Ku + g$. Thus, $P_{\overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}}f = Ku$. Such a $u \in \mathcal{U}$ must necessarily be a solution to {eq}`minres` because we have $\|Ku - f\|_{\mathcal{F}} = \|P_{\overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}}f - f\|_{\mathcal{F}} \leq \inf_{g\in \overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}}\|g  - f\|_{\mathcal{F}} \leq \inf_{v\in\mathcal{U}}\|Kv - f\|_{\mathcal{F}}.$ Here, we used the fact that the orthogonal projection on a subspace gives the element closest to the projected element and $\mathcal{R}(K) \subseteq \overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}$ allows to conclude the last inequality.

Finally, we show that the minimum-norm solution is unique. Denote the minimun-norm solution by $\widetilde{u}$. Now suppose we have another solution, $\widetilde{v}$, to {eq}`minres`. Since they both solve the normal equations we have $\widetilde{v} = \widetilde{u} + z$ with $z \in \mathcal{N}(K)$. It follows that $\|\widetilde{v}\|_{\mathcal{U}}^2 = \|\widetilde{u}\|_{\mathcal{U}}^2 + 2\langle \widetilde{u}, z \rangle_{\mathcal{U}} + \|z\|_{\mathcal{U}}^2$. Since $\widetilde{u} \in \mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$ we have  $\langle \widetilde{u}, z \rangle_{\mathcal{U}} = 0$ and hence $\|\widetilde{v}\|_{\mathcal{U}} \geq \|\widetilde{u}\|_{\mathcal{U}}$ with equality only obtained when $z = 0$.

```

---

The Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of $K$ gives us a way to construct the minimum-norm solution defined above. We can think of this pseudo-inverse as the inverse of a restricted forward operator.

```{admonition} Definition: *Moore-Penrose inverse*
:class: important

Given an bounded linear operator $K:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow \mathcal{F}$ we denote its restriction to $\mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$ as $\widetilde{K}:\mathcal{N}(K)^\perp\rightarrow\mathcal{R}(K)$. The M-P inverse $K^\dagger: \mathcal{R}(K)\oplus\mathcal{R}(K)^\perp \rightarrow \mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$ is defined as the unique linear extension of $\widetilde{K}^{-1}$ with $\mathcal{N}(K^\dagger) = \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp$.
```

```{admonition} *The range of $K^\dagger$*
:class: dropdown

Let $u\in\mathcal{R}(K^\dagger)$, then there exists a $f\in\mathcal{D}(K^\dagger)$ such that $u = K^\dagger f$. By definition we can decompose $f = f_1 + f_2$ with $f_1\in\mathcal{R}(K)$, $f_2 \in \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp$. Thus $K^\dagger f = K^\dagger f_1 = \widetilde{K}^{-1}f_1$. Hence, $u \in \mathcal{R}(\widetilde{K}^{-1}) = \mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$. This establishes that $\mathcal{R}(K^\dagger)\subseteq \mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$. Conversely, let $u\in\mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$. Then $u = \widetilde{K}^{-1}\widetilde{K} = K^\dagger K u$, whence $\mathcal{N}(K)^\perp \subseteq \mathcal{R}(K^\dagger)$. We conclude that $\mathcal{R}(K^\dagger) = \mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$.
```   

The pseudo-inverse satisfies a few useful relations:

```{admonition} Theorem: *Moore-Penrose equations*
:class: important

The M-P pseudo-inverse $K^{\dagger}: \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp \oplus \mathcal{R}(K) \rightarrow \mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$ of $K$ is unique and obeys the following useful relations:

1. $KK^\dagger = \left.P_{\overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}}\right|_{\mathcal{D}(K^\dagger)}.$
2. $K^\dagger K = I - P_{\mathcal{N}(K)},$
3. $K^\dagger K K^\dagger = K^\dagger,$
4. $KK^\dagger K = K,$
```

```{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

1. Decompose $f \in \mathcal{D}(K^\dagger)$ as $f = f_1 + f_2$ with $f_1\in\mathcal{R}(K)$, $f_2\in\mathcal{R}(K)^\perp$ and use that $K = \widetilde{K}$ on $\mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$. Then $KK^\dagger f = K\widetilde{K}^{-1}f_1 = f_1$. Hence, $KK^\dagger$ acts as an orthogonal projection of $f \in \mathcal{D}(K^\dagger)$ on $\overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}$.

2. Decompose $u \in \mathcal{U}$ in two parts $u = u_1 + u_2$ with $u_1 \in \mathcal{N}(K)$, $u_2\in\mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$
we have $K^\dagger K u = K^\dagger K u_1 = u_1$, so $KK^\dagger$ acts like an orthogonal projection on $\mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$ so $KK^\dagger = I - P_{\mathcal{N}(K}$ (note that the orthogonal complement of a subspace is always closed).

3. Since $KK^\dagger$  projects onto $\overline{R}(K)$, it filters out any components in $f$ in the null-space of $K^\dagger$ which would disappear anyway.

4. Since $K^\dagger K$ projects on $\mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$ if filters out any components in the null-space of $K$, which would disappear anyway.
```   
With these, we can show that the minimum-norm solution to {eq}`minres` is obtained by applying the pseudo-inverse to the data.

```{admonition} Theorem: *Minimum-norm solution*
:class: important

Let $K$ be a bounded linear operator with pseudo-inverse $K^{\dagger}$ and $f \in \mathcal{D}(K^\dagger)$, then the unique minimum-norm solution to {eq}`minres` is given by

$$\widetilde{u} = K^\dagger f.$$
```
```{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

We know that for $f \in \mathcal{D}(K^\dagger)$ the minimum-norm solution $\widetilde{u} \in \mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$ exists and unique. Using the fact that $K\widetilde{u} = P_{\overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}}f$ (due to the \textit{mimimum-residual} solution property) and the M-R equations, we have $\widetilde{u} = (I - P_{\mathcal{N}}(K))\widetilde{u} = K^\dagger K\widetilde{u} = K^\dagger P_{\overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}}f = K^\dagger K K^\dagger f = K^\dagger f$.
```

When defining the the solution through the M-P pseudo-inverse, we have existence uniqueness of the minimum-norm to {eq}`minres`. However, we cannot expect stability in general. For this, we would need $K^{\dagger}$ to be continuous. To see this, consider noisy data $f^{\delta} = f + e$ with $\|e\|\leq \delta$. For stability of the solution we need to bound the difference between the corresponding solutions $\widetilde{u}$, $\widetilde{u}^\delta$:

$$\|\widetilde{u} - \widetilde{u}^\delta\|_{\mathcal{U}} = \|K^{\dagger}e\|_{\mathcal{F}},$$

which we can only do when $K^\dagger$ is continuous (or, equivalently, bounded).


```{admonition} Theorem: *Continuity of the M-P pseudo-inverse*
:class: important

The pseudo-inverse $K^\dagger$ of $K$ is continuous iff $\mathcal{R}(K)$ is closed.
```

```{admonition} Proof
:class: dropdown

For the proof, we refer to Thm 2.5 of [these lecture notes](https://mehrhardt.github.io/data/201803_lecture_notes_invprob.pdf).
```

---

Let's consider a concrete example.

```{admonition} Example: Pseudo-inverse of a bounded operator
Consider the following forward operator

$$Ku(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty k(x-y)u(y)\mathrm{d}y,$$

with $k, u \in L^{1}(\mathbb{R})$. [Young's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_convolution_inequality) tells us that $\|Ku\|_{L^1(\mathbb{R})} \leq \|k\|_{L^1(\mathbb{R})} \cdot \|u\|_{L^1(\mathbb{R})}$ and hence that $K$ is bounded.

We can alternatively represent $K$ using [convolution theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem) as

$$Ku(x) = F^{-1} (\widehat{k} \widehat{u}) (x),$$

where $F : L^1(\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ denotes the [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#On_L1) and $\widehat{k} = Fk$, $\widehat{u} = Fu$.

This suggests defining the inverse of $K$ as

$$K^{-1}f = F^{-1} (\widehat{f} / \widehat{k}).$$

We note here that, by the [Riemann–Lebesgue lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann%E2%80%93Lebesgue_lemma), the Fourier transform of $k$ tends to zero at infinity. This means that the inverse of $K$ is only well-defined when $\widehat{f}$ decays faster than $\widehat{k}$. However, we can expect problems when $\widehat{k}$ has roots as well.

As a concrete example, consider $k = \text{sinc}(x)$ with $\widehat{k}(\xi) = H(\xi+1/2)-H(\xi-1/2)$. The forward operator then bandlimits the input. Can you think of a function in the null-space of $K$?

The pseudo-inverse may now be defined as

$$K^{\dagger}f = F^{-1} B \widehat{f},$$

where

$$B\widehat{f}(\xi) = \begin{cases} \widehat{f}(\xi) & |\xi| \leq 1/2 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}.$$
```

## Compact operators

An important subclass of the Bounded operators are the [compact operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_operator). They can be thought of as a natural generalization of matrices to the infinite-dimensional setting. Hence, we can generalize the notions from the [finite-dimensional setting](discrete_ip_regularization) to the infinite-dimensional setting.

---

There are a number of equivalent definitions of compact operators. We will use the following.

```{admonition} Definitition: *Compact operator*
:class: important

An operator $K: \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}$ with $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F}$ Hilbert spaces, is called *compact* if it can be expressed as

$$
K = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \sigma_j \langle \cdot, v_j\rangle_{\mathcal{U}}u_j,
$$

where $\{v_i\}$ and $\{u_i\}$ are orthonormal bases of $\mathcal{N}(K)^\perp$ and $\overline{\mathcal{R}(K)}$ respectively and
$\{\sigma_i\}$ is a null-sequence (i.e., $\lim_{i\rightarrow \infty} \sigma_i = 0$). We call $\{(u_i, v_i, \sigma_i)\}_{j=1}^\infty$ the singular system of $K$. The singular system obeys

$$Kv_j = \sigma_j u_j, \quad K^*u_j = \sigma_j v_j.$$
```

An important subclass of the compact operators are the [Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%E2%80%93Schmidt_integral_operator), which can be written as

$$Ku(x) = \int_{\Omega} k(x,y) u(y) \mathrm{d}y,$$

where $k: \Omega \times \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a Hilbert-Schmidt kernel obeying $\|k\|_{L^2(\Omega\times\Omega)} < \infty$ (i.e., it is square-integrable).

---

The pseudo-inverse of a compact operator is defined analogously to the finite-dimensional setting:

```{admonition} Definition: *Pseudo-inverse of a compact operator*
:class: important

The pseudo-inverse of a compact operator $K: \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}$ is expressed as

$$
K^{\dagger} = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \sigma_j^{-1} \langle \cdot, u_j\rangle_{\mathcal{F}}v_j,
$$

where $\{(u_i, v_i, \sigma_i)\}_{i=1}^\infty$ is the singular system of $K$
```

With this we can precisely state the Picard condition.

````{admonition} Definition: *Picard condition*
:class: important
Given a compact operator $K: \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}$ and $f \in \mathcal{F}$, we have that $f \in \mathcal{R}(K) \cup \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp$ iff
```{math}
:label: picard

\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{|\langle f, u_j\rangle_{\mathcal{F}}|^2}{\sigma_j^2} < \infty.
```
````

```{admonition} Remark : *Degree of ill-posedness*
:class: important

For inverse problems with compact operators we can thus use the *Picard condition* to check if {eq}`minres` has a solution. Although this establishes existence and uniqueness through the pseudo-inverse, it does not guarantee stability as $\sigma_j \rightarrow 0$. If $\sigma_j$ decays exponentially, we call the problem *severely ill-posed*, otherwise we call it *mildly ill-posed*.
```

---

Let's consider a few examples.

````{admonition} Example: A sequence operator

Consider the operator $K:\ell^2 \rightarrow \ell^2$, given by

$$
	u = (u_1,u_2,...) \mapsto (0,u_2,\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}u_3,...),
$$

i.e. we have an infinite matrix operator of the form

$$
K =
\left(\begin{matrix}
0 &             &             &        & \\
  & 1           &             &        & \\
  &             & \frac{1}{2} &        & \\
  &             &             & \ddots & \\
\end{matrix}\right)
$$

The operator is obviously linear. To show that is bounded we'll compute its norm:

$$
\|K\| = \sup_{u \neq 0} \frac{\|Ku\|_{\ell^2}}{\|u\|_{\ell^2}} = 1.
$$

```{admonition} derivation
:class: dropdown, note
We can fix $\|u\|_{\ell_2} = 1$ and verify that the maximum is obtained for $u = (0,1,0,\ldots)$ leading to $\|K\| = 1$.
```

To show that the operator is compact, we explicitly construct its singular system, giving:
$u_i = v_i = e_i$ with $e_i$ the $i^{\text{th}}$ canonical basis vector and $\sigma_1 = 0$, $\sigma_{i} = (i-1)^{-1}$ for $i > 1$.

```{admonition} derivation
:class: dropdown, note
Indeed, it is easily verified that $Ke_i = \sigma_i e_i$.
```

The pseudo inverse is then defined as

$$
K^{\dagger} =
\left(\begin{matrix}
0 &             &             &        & \\
  & 1           &             &        & \\
  &             & 2           &        & \\
  &             &             & \ddots & \\
\end{matrix}\right)
$$

This immediately shows that $K^\dagger$ is not bounded. Now consider obtaining a solution for $f = (1,1,\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}, \textstyle{\frac{1}{3}},\ldots)$. Applying the pseudo-inverse would yield $K^\dagger f = (0,1, 1, \ldots)$ which is not in $\ell_2$. Indeed, we can show that $f \not\in \mathcal{R}(K) \oplus \mathcal{R}(K)^\perp$. The problem here is that the range of $K$ is not closed.

````

---

````{admonition} Example: Differentiation

Consider $K:L_2([0,1]) \rightarrow L_2([0,1])$ defined as

$$
Ku(x) = \int_0^x u(y)\mathrm{d}y.
$$

Given $f(x) = Ku(x)$ we would naively let $u(x) = f'(x)$. Let's analyse this in more detail.

The operator can be expressed as

$$
Ku(x) = \int_0^1 k(x,y)u(y)\mathrm{d}y,
$$

with $k(x,y) = H(x-y)$, where $H$ denotes the Heaviside stepfunction. The operator is compact because $k$ is square integrable.

```{admonition} derivation
:class: dropdown, note

Indeed, we have

$$\int_0^1 \int_0^1 |k(x,y)|^2 \mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y = \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}.$$

We conclude that $k$ is a Hilbert-Schmidt kernel and hence that $K$ is compact.

```

The adjoint is found to be

$$
K^*f(y) = \int_0^1 k(x,y) f(x)\mathrm{d}x = \int_y^1 f(x)\mathrm{d}x.
$$

```{admonition} derivation
:class: dropdown, note

Using the definition we find

$$K^*f(y) = \int_0^1 k(x,y)f(x)\mathrm{d}x = \int_y^1 f(x)\mathrm{d}x.$$

```

The singular system is given by

$$
\sigma_k = ((k+1/2)\pi)^{-1},
$$
$$
u_k(x) = \sqrt{2}\sin(\sigma_k^{-1} x), 
$$
$$
\quad v_k(x) = \sqrt{2}\cos(\sigma_k^{-1} x).
$$

```{admonition} derivation
:class: dropdown, note
To derive the singular system, we first need to compute the eigenpairs $(\lambda_k, v_k)$ of $K^*K$. The singular system is then given by $(\sqrt{\lambda_k}, (\sqrt{\lambda_k})^{-1}Kv_k, v_k)$.

We find

$$
K^*Kv(y) = \int_y^1 \int_0^x v(z) \, \mathrm{d}z\mathrm{d}x = \lambda v(y).
$$

At $y = 1$ this yields $v(1) = 0$. Differentiating, we find

$$
\lambda v'(y) = -\int_0^y v(z)\mathrm{d}z,
$$

which yields $v'(0) = 0$. Differentiating once again, we find

$$
\lambda v''(x) = -v(x).
$$

The general solution to this differential equation is

$$
v(x) = a\sin(x/\sqrt{\lambda}) + b\cos(x/\sqrt{\lambda}).
$$

Using the boundary condition at $x = 0$ we find that $a = 0$. Using the boundary condition at $x = 1$ we get

$$
b\cos(1/\sqrt{\lambda}) = 0,
$$

which yields $\lambda_k = 1/((k + 1/2)^2\pi^2)$, $k = 0, 1, \ldots$. We choose $b$ to normalize $\|v_k\| = 1$.
```

The operator can thus be expressed as

$$
Ku(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\langle u, v_k\rangle}{(k+1/2)\pi} u_k(x),
$$

and the pseudo-inverse by

$$
K^{\dagger}f(x) = \pi\sum_{k=0}^\infty (k+1/2)\langle f, u_k\rangle v_k(x).
$$

We can now study the ill-posedness of the problem by looking at the Picard condition

$$
\|K^\dagger f\|^2 = \pi^2\sum_{k=0}^\infty f_k^2 (k+1/2)^2,
$$

where $f_k = \langle f, u_k\rangle$ are the (generalized) Fourier coefficients of $f$.

For this infinite sum to converge, we need strong requirements on $f_k$; for example $f_k = 1/k$ does not suffice to make the sum converge. This is quite surprising since such an $f$ is square-integrable. It turns out we need $f_k = \mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ to satisfy the Picard condition. Effectively this means that $f'$ needs to be square integrable. This makes sense since we saw earlier that $u(x) = f'(x)$ is the solution to $Ku = f$.

## Regularization

### Truncation and Tikhonov regularization

In the previous section we saw that the pseudo-inverse of a compact operator is not bounded (continuous) in general. To counter this, we introduce the regularized pseudo-inverse:

$$
K_{\alpha}^{\dagger}f = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} g_{\alpha}(\sigma_k) \langle f, u_k\rangle v_k,
$$

where $g_{\alpha}$ determines the type of regularization used. For Tikhonov regularisation we let

$$
g_{\alpha}(s) = \frac{s}{s^2 + \alpha}= \frac{1}{s + \alpha/s}.
$$

For a truncated SVD we let

$$
g_{\alpha}(s) = \begin{cases} s^{-1} & \text{if}\, s > \alpha \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}.
$$

We can show that the regularized pseudo inverse, $K_{\alpha}^{\dagger}$, is bounded for $\alpha > 0$ and converges to $K^\dagger$ as $\alpha \rightarrow 0$.

Given noisy data $f^{\delta} = f + e$ with $\|e\| \leq \delta$, we can now study the effect of regularization by studying the error. The total error is now given by

$$
\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger f^\delta - K^\dagger f\|_{\mathcal{U}} \leq \|K_{\alpha}^\dagger f - K^\dagger f\|_{\mathcal{U}} + \|K_{\alpha}^\dagger(f^\delta - f)\|_{\mathcal{U}},
$$

in which we recognize the *bias* and *variance* contributions. Note that we may bound this even further as

$$\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger f^\delta - K^\dagger f\|_{\mathcal{U}} \leq \|K_{\alpha}^\dagger - K^\dagger\| \|f\|_{\mathcal{F}} + \delta \|K_{\alpha}^\dagger\|.$$

Alternatively, we may express the error in terms of the minimum-norm solution $u = K^{\dagger} Ku = K^\dagger f$ as

$$\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger f^\delta - K^\dagger f\|_{\mathcal{U}} \leq \|I - K_{\alpha}^\dagger K\| \|u\|_{\mathcal{U}} +  \delta \|K_{\alpha}^\dagger\|.$$

Such upper bounds may be useful to study asymptotic properties of the problem but may be too loose to be used in practice. In that case a more detailed analysis incorporating the type of noise and the class of images $u$ that we are interested in is needed.

```{admonition} Example: Differentiation

Consider adding Tikhonov regularisation to stabilise the differentiation problem.
Take measurements $f^{\delta} = Ku + \delta\sin(\delta^{-1}x)$, where $\delta = \sigma_k$ for some $k$. The error $K^\dagger f^{\delta} - u$ is then given by

$$
K^\dagger K u - u + \delta K^{\dagger}\sin(\delta^{-1}\cdot).
$$

Because $\delta^{-1} = \sigma_k$ and $\sin(\sigma_k^{-1}x)$ is a singular vector of $K$ (or because the pseudo-inverse acts as taking a derivative), this simplifies to

$$
\cos(\sigma_k^{-1}x).
$$

Thus, the reconstruction error does not go to zero as $\delta\downarrow 0$, even though the error in the data does.

The eigenvalues of $K_{\alpha}^\dagger K$ are given by $(1 + \alpha \sigma_k^{-2})^{-1}$, with $\sigma_k = (\pi(k + 1/2))^{-1}$. The bias is thus given by

$$
\|I - K_{\alpha}^\dagger K\| = \max_{k} \left|1 - (1 + \alpha \sigma_{k}^{-2})^{-1}\right|.
$$

Likewise, the variance is given by

$$
\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger\| = \max_{k}\frac{1}{\sigma_k + \alpha \sigma_{k}^{-1}}.
$$



```
### Generalized Tikhonov regularization

We have seen in the finite-dimensional setting that Tikhonov regularization may be defined through a variational problem:

$$
\min_{u} \|Ku - f\|^2_{\mathcal{F}} + \alpha \|u\|^2_{\mathcal{U}}.
$$

It turns out we can do the same in the infinite-dimensional setting. Indeed, we can show that the corresponding normal equations are given by

$$(K^*\!K + \alpha I)u = K^*f.$$

Generalized Tikhonov regularization is defined in a similar manner through the variation problem

$$
\min_{u} \|Ku - f\|^2_{\mathcal{F}} + \alpha \|Lu\|^2_{\mathcal{V}},
$$

where $L:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow \mathcal{V}$ is a (not necessarily bounded) linear operator. The corresponding normal equations can be shown to be

$$(K^*\!K + \alpha L^*\!L)u = K^*f.$$

We can expect a unique solution when the intersection of the kernels of $K$ and $L$ is empty. In many applications, $L$ is a differential operator. This can be used to impose smoothness on the solution.

### Parameter-choice strategies

Given a regularization strategy with parameter $\alpha$, we need to pick $\alpha$. As mentioned earlier, we need to pick $\alpha$ to optimally balance between the bias and variance in the error. To highlight the basic flavors of parameter-choice strategies, we give three examples.

```{admonition} Example: *A-priori rules*

Assuming that we know the noise level $\delta$, we can define a parameter-choice rule $\alpha(\delta)$. We call such a rule *convergent* iff

$$\lim_{\delta\rightarrow 0} \alpha(\delta) = 0, \quad \lim_{\delta\rightarrow 0} \delta \|K_{\alpha(\delta)}^\dagger\| = 0.$$

With these requirements, we can easily show that the error $\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger f^{\delta} - K^\dagger f\|_{\mathcal{U}} \rightarrow 0$ as $\delta\rightarrow 0$.

Such parameter-choice rules are nice in theory, but hard to design in practice. One is sometimes interested in the *convergence rate*, which aims to bound the bias in terms of $\delta^\nu$ for some $0 < \nu < 1$. 
```

```{admonition} Example: *The discrepancy principle*

Morozov's discrepancy principle chooses $\alpha$ such that

$$\|KK_{\alpha}^\dagger f^{\delta} - f^{\delta}\|_{\mathcal{F}} \leq \eta \delta,$$

with $\eta > 1$ a fixed parameter. This can be interpreted as finding an $\alpha$ for which the solution fits the data in accordance with the noise level. Note, however, that such an $\alpha$ may not exist if (a significant part of) $f^\delta$ lies in the kernel of $K^*$. This is an example of an *a-posterior* parameter selection rule, as it depends on both $\delta$ and $f^\delta$.
```

```{admonition} Example: *The L-curve method*
Here, we choose $\alpha$ via

$$\min_{\alpha > 0} \|K_{\alpha}^\dagger f^\delta\|_{\mathcal{U}} \|KK_{\alpha}^\dagger f^\delta - f^\delta\|_{\mathcal{F}}.$$

The name stems from the fact that the optimal $\alpha$ typically resides at the corner of the curve $(\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger f^\delta\|_{\mathcal{U}}, \|KK_{\alpha}^\dagger f^\delta - f^\delta\|_{\mathcal{F}})$.

This rule has the practical advantage that no knowledge of the noise level is required. Such a rule is called a *heuristic* method. Unfortunately, it is not a convergent rule.
```

## Exercises

### Convolution

Consider the example in section [3.2](ip_function_spaces.html#bounded-operators-on-hilbert-spaces) with $k(x) = \exp(-|x|)$.

* Is the inverse problem ill-posed?
* For which functions $f$ is the inverse well-defined?

```{admonition} Answer
:class: hint, dropdown

Here we have $\widehat{k}(\xi) = \sqrt{2/\pi} (1 + \xi^2)^{-1}$ (cf. [this table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Tables_of_important_Fourier_transforms)). For the inverse we then need $(1 + \xi^2)\widehat{f}(\xi)$ to be bounded. We conclude that the inverse problem is ill-posed since a solution will not exist for all $f$. Moreover, we can expect amplification of the noise if it has non-zero Fourier coefficients for large $|\xi|$.

We can only define the inverse for functions $f$ whose Fourier transform decays rapidly in the sense that $\lim_{|\xi|\rightarrow} (1 + \xi^2)\widehat{f}(\xi) < \infty$. Examples are $f(x) = e^{-ax^2}$ or $f(x) = \text{sinc}(ax)$ for any $a > 0$. We may formalise this by introducing [Schwartz functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartz_space) but this is beyond the scope of this course.
```

### Differentiation

Consider the forward operator

$$
Ku(x) = \int_0^x u(y)\mathrm{d}y.
$$

We've seen in the example that the inverse problem is ill-posed. Consider the regularized least-squares problem

$$\min_{u} \|Ku - f^\delta\|^2 + \alpha \|u'\|^2,$$

with $\|\cdot\|$ denoting the $L^2([0,1])$-norm. In this exercise we are going to analyze how this type of regularization addresses the ill-posedness by looking at the variance term.

* Show that the corresponding regularized pseudo-inverse is given by

$$K_{\alpha}^\dagger = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\sigma_k \langle u_k, \cdot \rangle}{\sigma_k^2 + \alpha \sigma_k^{-2}} v_k(x),$$

where $\{(u_k,v_k,\sigma_k)\}_{k=0}^\infty$ denotes the singular system of $K$.

* Take $f^\delta(x) = f(x) + \sigma_k \sqrt{2}\sin(\sigma_k^{-1}x)$ with $\sigma_k$ a singular value of $K$ and show that for $\alpha > 0$ the variance $\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger (f^\delta - f)\| \rightarrow 0$ as $k \rightarrow 0$


```{admonition} Answer
:class: hint, dropdown

We will use the SVD of $K$ to express the solution and derive a least-squares problem for the coefficients of $u$ using the orthonormality of the singular vectors.

The right singular vectors are given by $v_k(x) = \sqrt{2}\cos\left(\sigma_k^{-1} x\right)$ with $\sigma_k = (\pi(k+1/2))^{-1}$. Since these constitute an orthonormal basis for the orthogonal complement of the kernel of $K$ we can express $u$ as

$$u(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k v_k(x) + w, $$

with $Kw = 0$. We'll ignore $w$ for the time being and assume without proof that $\{v_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ is an orthonormal basis for $L^2([0,1])$.

We can now express the least-squares problem in terms of the coefficients $a_k$ First note that

$$u'(x) = -\sum_{k=0}^\infty \sigma_k^{-1}a_k u_k(x),$$

with $u_k(x)$ denoting the left singular vectors $u_k(x) = \sqrt{2}\sin\left(\sigma_k^{-1} x\right)$. Then

$$\|u'\|^2 = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a_k^2}{\sigma_k^2},$$

and using the fact that $Kv_k = \sigma_k u_k$:

$$\|Ku - f\|^2 = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (\sigma_k a_k - f_k)^2,$$

with $f_k = \langle u_k, f\rangle$. The normal equations are now given by

$$\left(\sigma_k^2 + \alpha \sigma_k^{-2}\right)a_k = \sigma_k f_k,$$

yielding

$$u(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\sigma_k \langle u_k, f \rangle}{\sigma_k^2 + \alpha \sigma_k^{-2}} v_k(x).$$

We can now study what happens to the variance term $\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger e\|$ with $e_k(x) = \sigma_k \sin(x/\sigma_k)$. First note that (by orthogonality)

$$K_{\alpha}^\dagger e_k(x) = \frac{\sigma_k^2}{\sigma_k^2 + \alpha \sigma_k^{-2}} \cos(\sigma_k^{-1} x).$$

We see, as before, that for $\alpha = 0$ the variance is constant as $k\rightarrow \infty$ (i.e, noise level going to zero). For $\alpha > 0$, however, we see that the variance tends to zero.

```

### Convergent regularization

Consider the regularized pseudo-inverse

$$K^\dagger_{\alpha} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g_{\alpha}(\sigma_k) \langle u_k,\cdot\rangle v_k,$$

and let $f^\delta = f + e$ with $\|e\|_{\mathcal{F}} \leq \delta$. We are going to study the convergence of this method, i.e., how fast $\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger f^\delta - K^\dagger f\| \rightarrow 0$. You may assume that $f \in \mathcal{R}(K)$ and that $f^\delta$ obeys the Picard condition. We further let

$$g_{\alpha}(s) = \begin{cases} s^{-1} & s > \alpha \\ 0 & s \leq \alpha \end{cases}.$$

and $\alpha(\delta) = \sqrt{\delta}$.

* Show that the total error $\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger f^\delta - K^\dagger f\|$ converges to zero as $\delta \rightarrow 0$.

* Show that the variance term converges to zero as $\delta\rightarrow 0$ with rate $1/2$:

$$\|K_{\alpha}^\dagger e\|_{\mathcal{U}} = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\delta}).$$

Under additional assumptions on the minimum-norm solution we can provide a faster convergence rate in. Assume that for a given $\mu > 0$ there exists a $w$ such that $K^\dagger f = (K^*K)^{\mu} w$.

* Show that this condition implies that (i.e., more regularity of $f$)

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{|\langle f,u_k\rangle|^2}{\sigma_k^{2(1 + 2\mu)}} < \infty.$$

* Show that

$$\|K^\dagger_{\alpha} f - K^\dagger f\| = \mathcal{O}(\delta^{\mu}).$$

```{admonition} Answer
:class: dropdown, hint

* We split the error in its bias and variance terms and consider each separately. The bias term is given by $\|(K^\dagger - K_{\alpha}^\dagger)f\|$, which we express as

$$\|(K^\dagger - K_{\alpha}^\dagger)f\|^2 = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (\sigma_k^{-1} - g_{\alpha}(\sigma_k))^2 |\langle f, u_k\rangle|^2.$$

We can split off a factor $\sigma_k^{-1}$ and bound as

$$\|(K^\dagger - K_{\alpha}^\dagger)f\|^2 \leq \sup_k (1 - \sigma_k g_{\alpha}(\sigma_k))^2 \sum_{k=0}^\infty  \frac{|\langle f, u_k\rangle|^2}{\sigma_k^2}.$$

Since $f$ obeys the Picard condition, the second term is finite. The first term can be bounded because $0 < sg_{\alpha}(s) \leq 1$. Moreover, we see that at $\alpha = 0$ we have $(1 - \sigma_k g_{\alpha}(\sigma_k))^2 = 0$. We conclude that the bias converges to zero as $\delta \rightarrow 0$. We do not get a rate, however.

The variance term can be shown to converge to zero as well, as done below.

* We find

$$\|K^\dagger_{\alpha} e\| \leq \|K^\dagger_{\alpha}\| \delta,$$

with $\|K^\dagger_{\alpha(\delta)}\| = \sup_k |g_{\alpha(\delta)}(\sigma_k)|$. To bound this, we observe that $|g_{\alpha}(s)| \leq \alpha^{-1}$. Setting $\alpha = \sqrt{\delta}$ we get the desired result.

* Start from

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{|\langle f,u_k\rangle|^2}{\sigma_k^{2 + 4\mu}}$$

and substitute $f = K(K^*K)^{\mu} w = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \sigma_k^{2\mu+1}\langle w,u_k\rangle u_k$ to get

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \sigma_k^{2 + 4\mu}\frac{|\langle w,u_k\rangle|^2}{\sigma_k^{2 + 4\mu}} = \|w\|^2 < \infty.$$

* Starting again from the bias term, we can factor out an additional $\sigma^{4\mu}$ term. We then use that $s^{2\mu}(1 - sg_{\alpha}(s)) \leq \alpha^{2\mu} $ to find the desired result.

### Convolution through the heat equation

In this exercise we'll explore the relation between the heat equation and convolution with a Gaussian kernel. Define the forward problem $f = Ku$ via the initial-value problem

$$
v_t = v_{xx}, \quad v(0,x) = u(x), \quad f(x) = v(T,x).
$$

* Verify that the solution to the heat equation is given by

$$
v(t,x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} u(x') g_t(x - x')\mathrm{d}x',
$$

where $g_t(x)$ is the *heat-kernel*:

$$
g_t(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi t}}\exp(-(x/2)^2/t).
$$

You may assume that $u$ is sufficiently regular and use that $g_t(x)$ converges (in the sense of distributions) to $\delta(x)$ as $t \downarrow 0$.

* Show that we can thus express the forward operator as

$$
Ku(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi T}}\int_{\mathbb{R}} u(x') \exp(-(x - x')^2/(4T)) \mathrm{d}x'.
$$

* Show that the operator may be expressed as

$$
Ku = F^{-1}((Fu)\cdot(Fg_T)),
$$

where $\cdot$ denotes point-wise multiplication and $F$ denotes the [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform).

* Express the inverse of $K$ as multiplication with a filter $\widehat{h}$ (in the Fourier domain). How does ill-posed manifest itself here and how does it depend on $T$ ?

We define a regularized filter (in the Fourier domain) by *band limitation*:

$$\widehat{h}_{\alpha}(\xi) = \begin{cases} \widehat{h}(\xi) & \text{for} & |\xi|\leq \alpha^{-1} \\ 0 & \text{for} &|\xi| > \alpha^{-1}\end{cases}.$$

* Test its effect numerically on noisy data for $T = 2$ using the code below. In particular, design an a-priori parameter selection rule $\alpha(\delta)$ that ensures that the total error converges *and* stays below 1 (in relative sense). Does this rule do better than the naive choice $\alpha(\delta) = \delta$?


```{code-cell} ipython3

* We can easily verify that it indeed satisfies the differential equation by computing $v_t$ and $v_{xx}$. To show that it satisfies the initial condition, we take the limit $t\rightarrow 0$ and use that $\lim_{t\rightarrow 0} \int g_t(x)u(x) \mathrm{d}x = u(0)$.

* Setting $t = T$ in the previous expression gives the desired result.

* This follows from the [convolution theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem).

* The inverse of $K$ is naively given by multiplication with $(Fg_T)^{-1}$ in the Fourier domain. We have $\widehat{g}_T(\xi) \propto e^{-T \xi^2}$ so we can only usefully define the inverse on functions whose Fourier spectrum decays fast enough such that the inverse Fourier transform of $\widehat{f}/\widehat{g}_T$ can be defined. Thus a solution does not exist for a large class of $f$ and noise is amplified exponentially. This only gets worse for larger $T$.

* See the code below. We compute the total error using the function `reconstruct` which computes noisy data and reconstructs using the regularised inverse. To get a more stable result we average over a number of random instances of the noise. Using $\alpha(\delta) = \delta$ gives a (numerically) convergent result, however for large $\delta$ it gives a very large error. Picking $\alpha(\delta)$ to converge a bit slower allows one to keep the relative total error below 1. Note that we only show convergence of the error for one particular $u$, so we cannot conclude that this will work in general as in a previous exercise. If you like Fourier analysis and sampling theory, this may be a nice exercise.

### Discretisation

In this exercise, we explore what happens when discretizing the operator $K$. We'll see that discretization implicitly regularizes the problem and that refining the discretization brings out the inherent ill-posedness. Discretize $x_k = k\cdot h$ with $k = 1, \ldots, n$ and $h = 1/(n+1)$.

$$
Ku(x_i)=\int_0^{x_i} u(y)\mathrm{d}y \approx h\sum_{j=0}^n k_{ij} u(x_j),
$$

with $k_{ij} = k(x_i,x_j) = H(x_i - x_j)$, giving an $n\times n$ lower triangular matrix

$$
K = h\cdot\left(\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & \ldots \\ \vdots & & &\ddots \end{matrix}\right)
$$

1. Compute the SVD for various $n$ and compare the singular values and vectors to the ones of the continuous operator. What do you notice?

2. Take $f(x) = x^3 + \epsilon$ with $\epsilon$ is normally distributed with mean zero and variance $\delta^2$. Investigate the accuracy of the reconstruction (use `np.linalg.solve` to solve $Ku = f$). Note that the exact solution is given by $u(x) = 3x^2$. Do you see the regularizing effect of $n$?

The code to generate the matrix and its use are given below.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def getK(n):
    h = 1/(n+1)
    x = np.linspace(h,1-h,n)
    K = h*np.tril(np.ones((n,n)))

    return K,x
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
n = 200
delta = 1e-3

K,x = getK(n)
u = 3*x**2
f = x**3 + delta*np.random.randn(n)
ur = np.linalg.solve(K,f)

### Convolution on a finite interval

We can define convolution with a Gaussian kernel on a finite interval $[0,\pi]$ through the initial boundary-value problem

$$
v_t = v_{xx}, \quad v(t,0) = v(t,\pi) = 0,\quad v(0,x) = u(x)
$$

with $f(x) = v(1,x)$. The solution of the initial boundary-value problem is given by

$$
v(t,x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\exp(- k^2 t)\sin(k x),
$$

with $a_k$ are the Fourier sine coefficients of $u$:

$$
a_k = \langle u, \sin(k\cdot) \rangle = \frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^{\pi} u(x) \sin (k x) \mathrm{d}x.
$$
Assume that we use $ \langle u, v \rangle = \frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^{\pi} u(x) v(x) \mathrm{d}x$ as inner product and define the forward operator $f = Ku$ in terms of the solution of the IBVP as $f(x) = v(1,x)$.

---

**1.** Give the singular system of $K$, i.e., find $(\sigma_k, u_k, v_k)$ such that $Ku(x)$ can be expressed as

$$
Ku(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \sigma_k \langle u, v_k \rangle u_k(x).
$$

---

We can now define a *regularized* pseudo-inverse through the variational problem

$$
\min_{u} \|Ku - f\|^2 + \alpha R(u),
$$

where we investigate two types of regularization

1. $R(u) = \|u\|^2,$
2. $R(u) = \|u'\|^2.$

---

**2.** Show that these lead to the following regularized pseudo-inverses

1. $K_{\alpha}^\dagger f = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{\sigma_k + \alpha\sigma_k^{-1}}\langle f, u_k \rangle v_k(x).$
2. $K_{\alpha}^\dagger f = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{\sigma_k + \alpha k^2\sigma_k^{-1}}\langle f, u_k \rangle v_k(x)$

**hint:** you can use the fact that the $v_k$ form an orthonormal basis for functions on $[0,\pi]$ and hence express the solution in terms of this basis.

---

We can now study the need for regularization, assuming that the Fourier coefficients $f_k = \langle f, u_k \rangle$ of $f$ are given.

**3.** Determine which type of regularization (if any) is needed to satisfy the Picard condition in the following cases (you can set $\alpha = 1$ for this analysis)

1. $f_k = \exp(-2 k^2)$
2. $f_k = k^{-1}$

---

**4.** Compute the bias and variance for $u(x) = \sin(k x)$ and  measurements $f^{\delta}(x) = Ku(x) + \delta \sin(\ell x)$ for fixed $k < \ell$ and $\delta$. Plot the bias and variance for well-chosen $k,\ell$ and $\delta$ and discuss the difference between the two types of regularization.
